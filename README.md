# 🧠 Smart Multi-Tool LLM Agent

This is a Streamlit application that uses a **Meta LLaMA 3-based language model** with multiple tools to answer both **general** and **biomedical** queries. It automatically decides the best tool (PubMed or DuckDuckGo) to fetch relevant and accurate information based on your question.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Meta LLaMA 3 (8B-Instruct)**: Powerful open-source language model from Meta, hosted via Hugging Face.
* **DuckDuckGo Search Tool** 🌍: For real-time, general web search.
* **PubMed Tool** 🧬: For accessing biomedical research papers using PubMed.
* **Smart Tool Selection**: The agent picks the appropriate tool depending on your question.
* **Easy-to-use UI**: Built with Streamlit for a clean, interactive experience.
